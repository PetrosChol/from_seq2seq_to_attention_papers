# Blog Posts on Foundational NLP Research Papers

This repository contains blog posts that delve into and explain key research papers that have significantly shaped the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to provide accessible and insightful summaries, analyses, and discussions of these influential works for anyone interested in understanding the evolution of modern NLP techniques.

## Featured Research Papers and Blog Posts

This repository currently features blog posts covering the following seminal papers:

*   **"Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" (Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, Quoc V. Le, 2014)**
    *   **Blog Post:** [Link to your blog post on "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks"](link-to-your-blog-post-seq2seq.md)
    *   **Description:** This blog post explores the groundbreaking paper that introduced the sequence-to-sequence model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTMs. It covers the core concepts, architecture, training process, and the impact this paper had on tasks like machine translation.

*   **"Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate" (Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio, 2014)**
    *   **Blog Post:** [Link to your blog post on "Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate"](link-to-your-blog-post-attention.md)
    *   **Description:** This post dives into the influential paper that introduced the attention mechanism in neural machine translation. It explains how attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during translation, significantly improving performance over the basic sequence-to-sequence model.

*   **"Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification" (Jeremy Howard, Sebastian Ruder, 2018)**
    *   **Blog Post:** [Link to your blog post on "Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification"](link-to-your-blog-post-ulmfit.md)
    *   **Description:** This blog post discusses the ULMFiT paper, which presented a novel transfer learning approach for NLP tasks. It explains the key techniques like discriminative fine-tuning and slanted triangular learning rates, and how ULMFiT demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-training language models for various text classification problems.

*   **"Attention is All You Need" (Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, ≈Åukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin, 2017)**
    *   **Blog Post:** [Link to your blog post on "Attention is All You Need"](link-to-your-blog-post-transformer.md)
    *   **Description:** This post explores the seminal paper that introduced the Transformer architecture, a revolutionary approach that relies solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrent layers. It covers the self-attention mechanism, multi-head attention, positional encodings, and the impact of the Transformer on various NLP tasks.
